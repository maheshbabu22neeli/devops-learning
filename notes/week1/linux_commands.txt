What is DevSecOps

DevOps is the process of building, testing, deploying the applications continuously.
Basically, we can deploy and test the application on the same day with multiple tools to make the process smooth. 
We can achieve integration, testing, deploying, monitoring, application security and many using DevOps process. 


One my first notice, in order to become DevOps Engineer I came to know that we should be perfect in linux commands. 
Hence, I started understanding linux and its commands as a basic task. 

Below are the multiple commands that i have learned. These might be simple for some people, but it is better learn from beginning to make perfect. 

$ ls    				                            -> To list the files and folders in the current directory
$ ls -la  				                            -> to list the files and folder along with hidden files in details format
$ uname  				                            -> Tells the OS name
$ man uname 				                        -> Shows the details information of the OS
$ touch <file-name>			                        -> To create file
$ mkdir <folder-name>			                    -> To create folder
$ cat <file-Name>			                        -> To show the content of the file
$ cat > <file-name>			                        -> To add the content in the file
$ cat >> <file-name>			                    -> To append the content in the file
$ cp <source> <destination>		                    -> To copy the file/folder to the given destination
$ mv <source> <destination>		                    -> To move the file/folder to the given destination




Downloads:
---------
$ wget <https url to downlad any file/tar.gz>    				-> To download anything from the web
$ curl <any web url>								            -> To show the content on the machine, but it won't download


$ grep <any-string> <file-name>							        -> To search any string from the given file
$ grep '<any-string>$' <file-name>						        -> To search a string ending with the given string from the given file
$ grep '^<any-string>' <file-name> 						        -> To search a string beginning with the given string from the given file

$ head <file-name> 								                -> Displays top 10 lines
$ tail <file-name> 								                -> Displays bottom 10 lines
$ tail -f <file-name>								            -> Displays running file till we stop (simplay follow the file) mainly used to trace the logs

Divide the String
=================
$ echo "Mahesh,Babu,Neeli" | cut -d ','  -f1,3                  -> Cut the given string in fragments
  Mahesh,Neeli
$ echo "Mahesh,Babu,Neeli" | awk -F "," '{print $NF}'           -> awk is also used for divide the string using delimeter., but it has some advanced features
  Neeli
$ echo "Mahesh:Babu:Neeli" | awk -F ":" '{print $1F, $2F}'
