We already know that how to create user's.
Now lets see how to give permissions to any file/folder to the users.

Here we have three different types of access.

1. READ         - denoted by r      - permission in numeric 4
2. WRITE        - denoted by w      - permission in numeric 2
3. EXECUTE      - denoted by x      - permission in numeric 1

-                   rwx                     rwx             rwx
(file/directory)    (owner/user) - u        (group) - g     (others) - o

Assume we have file in our system.

$ ls
permissions.txt


$ chmod u+w permissions.txt                  - Give write access to Owner

$ chmod o+x permissions.txt                  - Give execute access to Others

$ chmod o-r permissions.txt                  - Remove read access to Others

$ chmod 777 permissions.txt                  - Give rwx access to Owner, Group and Others (4+2+1)00

$ chmod 600 permissions.txt                  - Give read and write access to User/Owner (4+2)00

$ chmod 641                                  - Give read,write access to Owner/User and read access to Group and execute access to Others (4+2)41

Note: Either OWNER or ROOT user can change the permissions/access levels
